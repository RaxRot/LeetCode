# LeetCode Practice Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, written in Java.

## Why this repo exists

I created this repository to track my progress and reinforce what I learn while solving algorithmic problems. Writing down the solutions helps me:

- Understand the logic behind each problem.
- Practice writing clean and efficient Java code.
- Review and revisit tricky problems later.
- Stay consistent and motivated throughout my learning journey.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are written primarily for personal learning. They may not always be the most optimal, but they reflect my current understanding. I do not recommend using them as copy-paste templates â€” instead, try to solve problems yourself first, then refer here if needed.
